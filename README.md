# Secure Resource System
# Overview
The Secure Resource System is a resource management system that focuses on storing resources securely using encryption and hashes. It provides a convenient way to create, save, load, and extract resources in a secure manner.

# Features
Resource Directory Creation: The system allows the creation of resource directories to organize different types of resources.

Resource Creation: Resources can be created within specific directories, specifying the source file path and the desired filename.

Resource Saving: The system supports saving all created resources, ensuring their secure storage.

Resource Loading: The saved resources can be loaded into the system for further use.

Resource Extraction: The system provides functionality to extract the loaded resources as needed.

# Usage
To utilize the Secure Resource System, follow these steps:

Initialize the system by calling resource::initialize().

Load the resources using resource::load_resources_main().

Extract the loaded resources for further processing or usage using resource::extract_resources().

(Optional) If you want to save new resources, follow these additional steps:

a. Create a directory using resource::create_directory(directory_name).

b. Create resources within the directory using resource::create_resource_in_directory(directory_name, source_file_path, desired_filename).

c. Save all created resources using resource::save_resources().

(Optional) Uncomment the save_resource_tests() function in the main() method to execute the saving functionality.

Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your requirements.

# Security Measures
This system employs encryption and hash techniques to ensure resource security. The details of the specific encryption and hashing algorithms used are not provided in this overview for security reasons. However, the implementation takes into account industry best practices for securing sensitive data.
